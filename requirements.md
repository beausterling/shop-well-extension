Powerful AI is moving from the cloud to the client, and this is your chance to build with it! Join the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025 to create new web applications or Chrome Extensions using a suite of built-in AI APIs and powerful models, including Gemini Nano. 

Here‚Äôs how you can use our innovative suite of APIs to bring your ideas to life: 

üí≠ Prompt API: generate dynamic user prompts and structured outputs, now with multimodal support for image and audio input. 

üî§ Proofreader API: correct grammar mistakes with ease. 

üìÑ Summarizer API: distill complex information into clear insights.  

üåê Translator API: add multilingual capabilities and translate text into your preferred language. 

‚úèÔ∏è Writer API: Create original and engaging text. 

üñäÔ∏è Rewriter API: Improve content with alternative options. 

These APIs work client-side, which means your AI features are delivered locally, with privacy, offline access, and cost-efficiency benefits. For you and your users, this means:

‚öôÔ∏è Creative freedom: Build freely without having to worry about server costs or quotas, enabling new, proactive AI patterns.

üîí Inherent privacy: Deliver hyper-personalized experiences with the guarantee that user input or context never leaves the device.

‚úÖ Network resilient UX: Create features with consistent availability and performance, including for users who are offline or on unstable connections.

Are you hoping to extend your web application or extension‚Äôs reach to even more users, including those on mobile devices? Implement a hybrid AI strategy with either Firebase AI Logic or the Gemini Developer API.

Ready to get started? To gain access to the latest documentation, stay up-to-date with new APIs, and join the community, be sure to sign up for the Chrome Built-in AI Early Preview Program. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or new to hackathons, this challenge is your opportunity to share your vision to define the future of client-side AI. We want to see how you‚Äôll give the web a brain boost and a creative spark! 


Note: All hackathon projects must be new and original for this year‚Äôs event. If you participated in the 2024 hackathon, you cannot reuse the same project or project concept. Your entry must use a new idea and a new application.
