                    <h2>It Started in December 2021</h2>
                    <p>
                        My partner contracted COVID-19 in December 2021. What we thought would be a few weeks of
                        recovery turned into a life-altering journey that continues to this day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within months, they developed POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), ME/CFS
                        (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), and what seemed like countless new
                        food and environmental allergies. Simple activities like standing, walking, or eating foods
                        they'd enjoyed their entire life became unpredictable triggers for debilitating symptoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our lives changed overnight.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>The Hidden Challenge: Shopping</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the most frustrating—and unexpected—challenges was shopping. Suddenly, every product
                        needed to be scrutinized: Does it contain allergens? What about fragrances or preservatives?
                        Are the materials safe for sensitive skin? Will the ingredients trigger a POTS flare or worsen
                        ME/CFS symptoms?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Online shopping became a maze of uncertainty. Product descriptions were vague. Ingredient
                        lists were buried or incomplete. Reviews rarely mentioned the details we desperately needed
                        to know. Each purchase felt like a gamble—and the cost of being wrong wasn't just wasted
                        money, it was days of symptoms and suffering.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I watched my partner spend hours researching a single product—cross-referencing ingredients,
                        searching Reddit threads, calling manufacturers—all while battling brain fog and extreme fatigue.
                        It was exhausting to witness, and it felt deeply unfair.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>There Had to Be a Better Way</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a software engineer, and I kept thinking: <em>"There has to be a way to make this easier."</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I knew AI could help analyze product information quickly. I knew Chrome had released built-in
                        AI capabilities that run entirely on-device—no servers, no data collection, complete privacy.
                        And I knew there were millions of people like my partner who were struggling with the same
                        problems every single day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I built Shop Well.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-section">
                    <h2>What Shop Well Does Differently</h2>
                    <p>
                        Shop Well isn't just another product recommendation tool. It's designed specifically for people
                        whose bodies react unpredictably to ingredients, fragrances, materials, and additives that most
                        people never think twice about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It uses Chrome's on-device AI to analyze products in real-time while you shop—scanning for
                        allergens, identifying potentially problematic ingredients, and providing condition-specific
                        insights for POTS, ME/CFS, and Celiac Disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most importantly, it's built with privacy at its core. All processing happens locally on your
                        device. No data is sent to external servers. No account required. Because I understand that
                        privacy matters—especially when it comes to health information.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-section" id="mission">
                    <h2>The Mission: Helping Others Like Us</h2>
                    <p>
                        My partner's journey taught me that chronic illness doesn't just affect health—it impacts
                        every aspect of daily life, including something as simple as buying a bottle of shampoo or
                        a bag of snacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shop Well is my way of helping others in the chronic illness community reclaim some control
                        and reduce the cognitive burden of shopping. If this tool can save even one person hours of
                        research, or help them avoid a purchase that would have triggered symptoms, then it's worth it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This extension is—and will always be—completely free. No subscriptions, no premium tiers,
                        no monetization. It's built for the community, by someone who's seen firsthand how hard
                        it can be to navigate the world with chronic conditions.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-section story-cta">
                    <h2>You're Not Alone</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you're reading this because you or someone you love is struggling with POTS, ME/CFS, Celiac
                        Disease, or chronic allergies—I see you. I know how exhausting it is. I know how isolating it
                        can feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shop Well won't solve everything, but I hope it can make one small part of your day a little easier.

                        <p>
                            I'm a software engineer and partner to someone living with POTS, ME/CFS, and multiple
                            chronic conditions following COVID-19. Shop Well was born from countless hours spent
                            watching my loved one struggle with the hidden challenges of chronic illness—including
                            the seemingly simple act of shopping.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe technology should serve people, especially those who need it most. Shop Well
                            is my contribution to the chronic illness community—a community I've come to know well,
                            respect deeply, and want to support in any way I can.
